# ðŸª– Veterans Bridge: AI-Powered Veteran Support Onboarding

**Veterans Bridge** is a web-based tool that helps U.S. military veterans self-identify their needs across employment, mental health, wellness, and engagement â€” and receive personalized recommendations to connect and support using AI.

Built for the [AI+ Expo Hackathon 2025](https://expo.scsp.ai/hackathon/), this project leverages **Metaâ€™s Llama model** to intelligently group veterans into support categories based on their selected attributes.
